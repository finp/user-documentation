= Key features

Red Hat Managed Integration is a hosted and managed platform for developing, deploying, and scaling cloud-native, integrated applications. The combination of developer tooling, API-first approach to integration, and managed operations allows teams to focus on accelerating time to value and reduce operational cost.

*Services:* Integration capabilities and services which are fully hosted and managed integration components that are pre-installed and pre-configured on an openshift dedicated cluster. The products available as services are:

* API management ({three-scale-name})
* Enterprise connectivity ({fuse-short-name})
* Messaging ({amq-online-name})
* Single sign-on ({rhsso-name})
* Integrated development environment ({code-ready-name})

*Solution Patterns:* Pre-developed solution patterns demonstrate best practices and help development teams get started quickly. They provide a framework for organizations to create additional solution patterns in the cluster to standardize best practices.

*Solution Explorer:* A unified front-end web application that provides access to the installed products, development tools, solution patterns, and the Red Hat OpenShift console.

Technical preview features are not enabled by default in {PRODUCT} clusters. For example, the Internet of Things (IoT) feature of AMQ Online is not enabled. Any exceptions are labeled in the Solution Explorer.

[id="known-issues"]
= Known issues

This section lists known issues with Red Hat Managed Integration 2.1.0:

* There is an intermittent issue where the user is redirected to the login page when logging into the {unifiedpush-service} or {fuse-name}. To workaround this issue, clear the cookies in your browser.
* Service Discovery as described in the link:{three-scale-service-discovery}[3scale documentation] does not work in RHMI 2.1.
For example, you cannot successfully complete the _4 - Protecting APIs using 3scale API Management Platform_ Solution Pattern.
* If you log into OpenShift console as a {cluster-developer} and then switch to the Developer perspective, you get a "Restricted Access" error. To workaround this issue, select a project from the project drop-down menu.
* There is an intermittent issue where logging out of the {webapp} allows the user to log back in again without requiring login credentials.
