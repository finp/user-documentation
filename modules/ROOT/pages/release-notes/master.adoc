Red Hat Managed Integration is a hosted and managed platform for developing, deploying, and scaling cloud-native, integrated applications. The combination of developer tooling, API-first approach to integration, and managed operations allows teams to focus on accelerating time to value and reduce operational cost.

*Platform:* Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated

OpenShift Dedicated is a platform for developing and running containerized applications. It is designed to allow applications and the data centers that support them to expand from just a few machines and applications to thousands of machines that serve millions of clients.

*Services:* Fully hosted and managed integration products are pre-installed and pre-configured in a dedicated cluster. The products available as services are:

* Red Hat 3scale (API management)
* Fuse Online (Enterprise connectivity)
* Red Hat AMQ Online (Messaging)
* RH SSO (Single sign-on )
* Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces (Integrated development environment )

*Solution Patterns:* Pre-developed solution patterns demonstrate best practices and help development teams get started quickly. They provide a framework for organizations to create additional solution patterns in the cluster to standardize best practices.

*Solution Explorer:* A unified front-end web application that provides access to the installed products, development tools, solution patterns, and the Red Hat OpenShift console.

Technical preview features are not enabled by default in {PRODUCT} clusters. For example, the Internet of Things (IoT) feature of AMQ Online is not enabled. Any exceptions are labeled in the Solution Explorer.

//In the title of a reference module, include nouns that are used in the body text. For example, "Keyboard shortcuts for ___" or "Command options for ___." This helps readers and search engines find the information quickly.

A short introductory paragraph is required for the reference module.
It will provide an overview of the module.

A reference module provide data that users might want to look up, but do not need to remember.
It has a very strict structure, often in the form of a list or a table.
A well-organized reference module enables users to scan it quickly to find the details they want.
AsciiDoc markup to consider for reference data:

.Unordered list
* For more details on writing reference modules, see the link:https://github.com/redhat-documentation/modular-docs#modular-documentation-reference-guide[Modular Documentation Reference Guide].
* Use a consistent system for file names, IDs, and titles.
For tips, see _Anchor Names and File Names_ in link:https://github.com/redhat-documentation/modular-docs#modular-documentation-reference-guide[Modular Documentation Reference Guide].
