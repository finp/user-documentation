//If the assembly covers a task, start the title with a verb in the gerund form, such as Creating or Configuring.

This paragraph is the assembly introduction. It explains what the user will accomplish by working through the modules in the assembly and sets the context for the user story the assembly is based on. Can include more than one paragraph. Consider using the information from the user story.
// The following include statements pull in the sub-assemblies and the module files that comprise the assembly. Include any combination of concept, procedure, or reference modules required to cover the user story.

// \include::.assemblies/CATEGORY/as_sub-assembly-id.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
// [leveloffset=+1] ensures that when a module starts with a level-1 heading (= Heading), the heading will be interpreted as a level-2 heading (== Heading) in the assembly.

// \include::modules/CATEGORY/TYPE_use-module-id-here.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
// Where TYPE_ can be one of p_, c_, or r_ for 'procedure', 'concept', or 'reference'

The {webapp} presents links to the applications available in a {PRODUCT_SHORT} cluster. The {webapp} provides Solution Patterns that guide users through the process of creating various integrated solutions using these applications.


{PRODUCT_SHORT} provides access to the following consoles:

* *OpenShift*, the OpenShift cluster console.

* *API Designer*,  the Apicurito RESTful API visual designer.

* *Red Hat 3scale API Management*, a platform that provide RESTful API Management.

* *Red Hat AMQ*, fast, lightweight, and secure messaging for Internet-scale applications.

* *Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces*, a developer workspace server and cloud IDE.

* *Red Hat Fuse Online*, a facility to obtain data from an application or service, operate on that data, and then send the data to another application or service without writing code.

* *Push Notifications*, a service to push notifications to Android and iOS devices.

* *Red Hat Single Sign-On*, a single sign-on solution for web apps and RESTful web services.

[NOTE]
====
Most applications are available in the {webapp}, after you log in; however, if *Red Hat AMQ Online* is not available, the *Start service* button is displayed. Click *Start service* to provision it.

Solution Patterns are tutorials available in {PRODUCT_SHORT}. The default Solution Patterns guide you through the following scenarios:

* Connecting applications using asynchronous messaging
* Protecting applications using single sign-on
* Low-code API development and SaaS integration
* Protecting APIs using 3scale API Management Platform
* Adding Data Sync to your application with GraphQL


These Solution Patterns are available in the {webapp}.

[id="about-sso"]
= About the {customer-sso-name}

{PRODUCT_SHORT} includes an instance of {rhsso-name} to enable you protect any applications you deploy on your cluster.

Red Hat manages this instance, however all {cluster-administrator}s have admin level privileges to configure this instance.

A user named `admin` is used to manage this instance. Do not delete this user.
{cluster-administrator}
A {cluster-administrator} typically uses this instance to:

* create users in the `master` realm

* add an Identity Provider in the `master` realm as described in link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_single_sign-on/7.3/html/server_administration_guide/identity_broker[Identity Brokering] to avoid managing the same users in different realms

* create and manage new realms
