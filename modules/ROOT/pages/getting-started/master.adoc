{PRODUCT} is a platform for developing and deploying enterprise integration solutions.
It is hosted and managed by Red Hat so you can focus on building applications, not infrastructure.

{PRODUCT_SHORT} enables your team to develop, build, and deploy enterprise integration solutions on an OpenShift Dedicated cluster managed by Red Hat.

{PRODUCT_SHORT} provides a simplified cloud-native experience and includes:

* Solution Explorer: A web-based UI with single sign-on access to all the applications.
* Solution Patterns: Step-by-step instructions and best practices for common connectivity and application development tasks.
* Applications: Pre-installed infrastructure components are configured for optimal performance.

All of the applications and services are protected by your identity provider.

{PRODUCT_SHORT} includes a managed instance of {rhsso-name} to enable you to protect any applications you deploy on your cluster.
This application is labeled *{customer-sso-name}* in the Solution Explorer.

NOTE: Do not delete the `admin` user in the {customer-sso-name}. This user is required by Red Hat to manage the instance.

The {webapp} is a web-based UI with single sign-on access to all the applications available in your {PRODUCT_SHORT} cluster:

* *OpenShift*, the OpenShift cluster console.

* *API Designer*,  the Apicurito RESTful API visual designer.

* *Red Hat 3scale API Management*, a platform that provides RESTful API Management.

* *Red Hat AMQ*, a fast, lightweight, and secure messaging solution for Internet-scale applications.

* *Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces*, a developer workspace server and cloud IDE.

* *Red Hat Fuse Online*, a facility to obtain data from an application or service, operate on that data, and then send the data to another application or service without writing code.

* *Push Notifications*, a service to push notifications to Android and iOS devices.

* *Red Hat Single Sign-On*, a single sign-on solution for web apps and RESTful web services.

The {webapp} also provides xref:introduction-to-solution-patterns[Solution Patterns] that provide step-by-step instructions and best practices for common connectivity and application development tasks.

[id="configuring-new-cluster_{context}"]

= Configuring a new {PRODUCT_SHORT} cluster


A {cluster-administrator} must configure the {PRODUCT_SHORT} cluster before {cluster-developer}s can start creating {solution-name}.


.Procedure

. Log in to the {webapp}. The URL for the {webapp} is included with the email Red Hat sends you when your cluster becomes available.

. Share the {webapp} URL with the {cluster-developer}s in your organization.



:leveloffset!:

Depending on the applications that your team plans to use, you might need to configure a GitHub OAuth app for {code-ready-name} and give {cluster-developer}s administrative privileges in {three-scale-name}.

[id="configuring-github-oauth-for-codeready-workspaces_{context}"]
= Configuring GitHub OAuth for CodeReady Workspaces

{PRODUCT} provides a full developer workspace server and cloud IDE with {code-ready-short}, allowing you to pull and push to GitHub projects. You must configure a GitHub OAuth app before {cluster-developer}s can pull and push GitHub projects.
The GitHub OAuth app allows users to import projects into {code-ready-short} by using SSH addresses (`git@`). Users can then push to repositories and use the pull request panel.

This procedure enables automatic SSH key upload to GitHub.

.Prerequisites

* You must have prior experience using GitHub.
* You are a {cluster-administrator}.

.Procedure

. Register an application on GitHub:
**  To add a new application, log in to GitHub and go to OAuth applications in your developer settings. Click https://github.com/settings/profile[Settings] ->
https://github.com/settings/apps[Developer settings] ->
https://github.com/settings/developers[OAuth Apps] ->
https://github.com/settings/applications/new[Register a new OAuth application].
** For GitHub Enterprise, go to your GitHub Enterprise homepage and then click
*Settings -> Developer settings -> Register a new application*.
. Enter an application name, for example, `CodeReady Workspaces`.
. For the homepage URL, enter the CodeReady Workspaces URL.
+
[subs="attributes"]
----
{codeready-workspaces-url}
----
+
where <cluster-suffix> is the unique sub-domain for your cluster.
For example, {suffix-example}

. Enter the authorization callback URL:
+
[subs="attributes"]
----
{authorization-callback-url}
----
+
where <cluster-suffix> is the unique sub-domain for your cluster.
For example, {suffix-example}

. Click *Register application*.

. Note the GitHub *Client ID* and GitHub *Client Secret*. You require these values later in the procedure.

. Log in to the OpenShift console as a {cluster-administrator}.

. Navigate to the following URL in your browser:
+
[subs="attributes"]
----
{github-oauth-secret-url}
----
+
where <cluster-suffix> is the unique sub-domain for your cluster.
For example, {suffix-example}

. Select the *Edit Secret* option from the *Actions* menu.
. Enter the GitHub Client ID and Client Secret that you previously noted:
.. Enter the GitHub Client ID for the value of *Client ID*.
.. Enter the GitHub Client Secret for the value of *Secret*.
. Click *Save*.

. To validate, request that a {cluster-developer} creates a workspace and connects to GitHub:
.. Log in to Solution Explorer.
.. Navigate to {code-ready-short}.
.. Create a workspace as described in link:{creating-workspace-link}[Creating and configuring a new CodeReady Workspaces 2.0 workspace].
.. Click *Add or Import Project* -> *GitHub* -> *Connect your GitHub account* -> *Authorize*.
.. Check that a list of projects is displayed in the Import Projects panel. If projects are not displayed, verify that you followed each step in this procedure.

.Additional resources

* See the link:{URL_BASE}/administration_guide_for_red_hat_managed_integration_2/[{PRODUCT_SHORT} Administration Guide] for more information on administering your cluster.

* As a {cluster-administrator} you can perform all the tasks described in link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_dedicated/4/html-single/administering_a_cluster/index[Administering an OpenShift Dedicated cluster].
+
NOTE: This release of {PRODUCT} does not support the tasks described in the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_dedicated/4/html-single/getting_started/index[Getting started with OpenShift Dedicated 4].

.Prerequisites

* You are a {cluster-developer}.
* You have the {webapp} URL.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {webapp}.

. Select the *All Solution Patterns* tab. The default Solution Patterns are displayed.
+
NOTE: See link:{URL_BASE}/developer_guide_for_red_hat_managed_integration_2/index#adding-solution-patterns[Adding Solution Patterns] for information about how to subscribe your cluster to a Git repository that contains more Solution Patterns.

. Perform the *1 - Connecting applications using asynchronous messaging* Solution Pattern to learn about using AMQ Online and Fuse Online.

. Perform the *2 - Protecting applications using single sign-on* Solution Pattern to learn about using the {customer-sso-name} to protect end-user applications.
+
NOTE: You must complete the *1 - Connecting applications using asynchronous messaging* Solution Pattern before performing this Solution Pattern.

. Perform the *3 - Low-code API development and SaaS integration* Solution Pattern to learn more about using Fuse Online with external services.

. Perform the *4 - Protecting APIs using 3scale API Management Platform* Solution Pattern to learn about protecting APIs with {three-scale-name}.
When navigating to 3scale, choose *Authenticate through Red Hat Single Sign-On* when prompted to *Log in to your Account*.
