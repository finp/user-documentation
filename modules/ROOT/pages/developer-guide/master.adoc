= Introduction
//In the title of concept modules, include nouns or noun phrases that are used in the body text. This helps readers and search engines find the information quickly.
//Do not start the title of concept modules with a verb. See also _Wording of headings_ in _The IBM Style Guide_.

A short introductory paragraph is required for the concept module.
It will provide an overview of the module.

The contents of a concept module give the user descriptions and explanations needed to understand and use a product.

* Look at nouns and noun phrases in related procedure modules and assemblies to find the concepts to explain to users.
* Explain only things that are visible to users. Even if a concept is interesting, it probably does not require explanation if it is not visible to users.
* Do not include any instructions to perform an action, such as executing a command. Action items belong in procedure modules.

.Additional resources

* A bulleted list of links to other material closely related to the contents of the concept module.
* For more details on writing concept modules, see the link:https://github.com/redhat-documentation/modular-docs#modular-documentation-reference-guide[Modular Documentation Reference Guide].
* Use a consistent system for file names, IDs, and titles. For tips, see _Anchor Names and File Names_ in link:https://github.com/redhat-documentation/modular-docs#modular-documentation-reference-guide[Modular Documentation Reference Guide].
