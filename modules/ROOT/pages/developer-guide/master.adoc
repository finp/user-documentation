= The {PRODUCT_SHORT} developer experience

//This section describes the tools and techniques that a developer typically uses in a {PRODUCT} cluster.

{PRODUCT} provides developers with tools and techniques to create and manage applications on a secure platform.

Developers can use Solution Explorer to access the various user interfaces available in the cluster.

If you are a new user, Red Hat recommends starting with the Solution Patterns in the *All Solution Patterns* tab of the {webapp}. These Solution Patterns introduce you to essential Managed Integration capabilities.

As a developer, you can:

* Create and edit OpenShift projects
* Develop applications using {code-ready-name}
* Create a realm in the {customer-sso-name}
* Create Fuse Online integrations and view logs
* Create address spaces and addresses in AMQ Online
* Edit methods, metrics, and mapping rules of the 3scale backend

If a {cluster-developer} needs to create products in 3scale, a {cluster-administrator} must give that user *Admin* rights as described in the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_3scale_api_management/2.8/html/admin_portal_guide/inviting-users-managing-rights#give_new_users_rights[3scale documentation].

NOTE: Red Hat recommends that you use an external authentication service for AMQ Online address spaces in a production environment.

A {cluster-developer} can also use the OpenShift CLI tools on a local machine to interact with a  {PRODUCT} cluster.
The client is available from the link:https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290/ver=4.3/rhel---8/4.3.5/x86_64/product-software[download] page.

{PRODUCT} enables you to deploy apps to your cluster as described in the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_dedicated/4/html-single/applications/index#projects[Applications guide].

You can create projects to manage your development work:

* You can create AMQ Online address space definitions in your project as described in link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq/7.6/html-single/using_amq_online_on_openshift/index#create-address-space-cli-messaging[Creating address spaces using the command line]. The resulting pods are created in the `redhat-rhmi-amq-online` project, which is managed by Red Hat.
* If you delete the project, all associated resources are also deleted. For example, address spaces that you defined in your project are deleted.
* Sharing access to projects is described in the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_dedicated/4/html-single/applications/index#odc-providing-project-permissions-using-developer-perspective_projects[Applications] guide.

:context: builds

{PRODUCT} enables you to deploy apps to your cluster as described in the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_dedicated/4/html-single/builds/index[builds] guide. The following procedures are reproduced for your convenience.

[id="builds-about_{context}"]
= Builds

A _build_ is the process of transforming input parameters into a resulting
object. Most often, the process is used to transform input parameters or source
code into a runnable image. A `BuildConfig` object is the definition of the
entire build process.

{product-title} uses Kubernetes by creating containers
from build images and pushing them to a container image registry.

Build objects share common characteristics including inputs for a build, the requirement to
complete a build process, logging the build process, publishing resources from
successful builds, and publishing the final status of the build. Builds take
advantage of resource restrictions, specifying limitations on resources such as
CPU usage, memory usage, and build or pod execution time.




The resulting object of a build depends on the builder used to create it. For
Docker and S2I builds, the resulting objects are runnable images. For Custom
builds, the resulting objects are whatever the builder image author has
specified.

Additionally, the Pipeline build strategy can be used to implement sophisticated
workflows:

* Continuous integration
* Continuous deployment

[id="builds-strategy-docker-build_{context}"]
= Docker build

The Docker build strategy invokes the docker build command, and it expects a
repository with a *_Dockerfile_* and all required artifacts in it to produce a
runnable image.

[id="build-strategy-s2i_{context}"]
= Source-to-Image (S2I) build

Source-to-Image (S2I) is a tool for building reproducible, Docker-formatted
container images. It produces ready-to-run images by injecting application
source into a container image and assembling a new image. The new image
incorporates the base image (the builder) and built source and is ready to use
with the `buildah run` command. S2I supports incremental builds, which re-use
previously downloaded dependencies, previously built artifacts, etc.

The advantages of S2I include the following:

[horizontal]
Image flexibility:: S2I scripts can be written to inject
application code into almost any existing Docker-formatted container image,
taking advantage of the existing ecosystem. Note that, currently, S2I relies on
`tar` to inject application source, so the image needs to be able to process
tarred content.

Speed:: With S2I, the assemble process can perform a large number of complex
operations without creating a new layer at each step, resulting in a fast
process. In addition, S2I scripts can be written to re-use artifacts stored in a
previous version of the application image, rather than having to download or
build them each time the build is run.

Patchability:: S2I allows you to rebuild the application consistently if an
underlying image needs a patch due to a security issue.

Operational efficiency:: By restricting build operations instead of allowing
arbitrary actions, as a *_Dockerfile_* would allow, the PaaS operator can avoid
accidental or intentional abuses of the build system.

Operational security:: Building an arbitrary *_Dockerfile_* exposes the host
system to root privilege escalation. This can be exploited by a malicious user
because the entire Docker build process is run as a user with Docker privileges.
S2I restricts the operations performed as a root user and can run the scripts
as a non-root user.

User efficiency:: S2I prevents developers from performing arbitrary `yum
install` type operations, which could slow down development iteration, during
their application build.

Ecosystem:: S2I encourages a shared ecosystem of images where you can leverage
best practices for your applications.

Reproducibility:: Produced images can include all inputs including specific versions
of build tools and dependencies. This ensures that the image can be reproduced
precisely.

[id="build-strategy-custom-build_{context}"]
= Custom build

The Custom build strategy allows developers to define a specific builder image
responsible for the entire build process. Using your own builder image allows
you to customize your build process.

A Custom builder image is a plain Docker-formatted container image embedded with
build process logic, for example for building RPMs or base images.

Custom builds run with a very high level of privilege and are not available to
users by default. Only users who can be trusted with cluster administration
permissions should be granted access to run custom builds.

----
where `<org>` is the name of your GitHub organization and `<repo>` is the name of your repository.
+
[NOTE]
====
* List URLs in the order you want them to appear in the {webapp}.
* Enter one URL per line.
* To include a specific branch, append #<branch-name> to the url.
====

. Click *Save*.
+
Editing the value triggers an automatic redeployment of the {webapp}.

. When the deployment is complete, refresh your browser.
+
You should now see new Solution Patterns available from the dashboard.


. If the Git repository is updated with new content, the {webapp} is not automatically updated.
+
Redeploy the {webapp} to view the changes:
+
.. Click the gear icon in the top right to display the **Application settings** screen.
.. Click Save to trigger a redeployment of the Solution Explorer app.
.. When the deployment is complete, refresh your browser.
.. Navigate to the **Solution Patterns** tab to see the updated content.
