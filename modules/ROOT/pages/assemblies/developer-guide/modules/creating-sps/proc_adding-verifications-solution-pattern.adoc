Verifications are interactive elements in a Solution Pattern that confirm whether a user has successfully completed a procedure. They are questions presented to the user, which can be answered with either a `Yes` or `No` response.

NOTE: Every procedure in a task or subtask requires a verification.

----
. Add the following block to cater for users that answer the question with `No`:
