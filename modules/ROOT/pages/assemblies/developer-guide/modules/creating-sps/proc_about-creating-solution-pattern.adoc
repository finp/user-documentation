= Creating solution patterns

To write Solution Patterns you require a knowledge of:

* Asciidoc - a lightweight markup language, similar to markdown
* JSON - a lightweight format for storing and transporting data
* Git - you must push your Asciidoc and JSON files to a Git repository
* OpenShift - you can add Solution Patterns using the OpenShift console

A simple Solution Pattern only requires that you edit an Asciidoc file, for example:

[source,asciidoc]
----
= Demonstrating features <1>

A short description for the feature. <2>

== Doing a task <3>

. Do this first: <4>
. Do this second:
----
<1> Solution Pattern title, you can only have a single level 1 heading per file.
<2> The first line of the introduction is displayed as a tag line for the Solution Pattern and displayed on the {webapp} home page.
Do not use AsciiDoc attributes in this line because they are not displayed correctly on the homepage.
<3> A task contains one or more subtasks (level 3 headings)
<4> A numbered list of steps the user must perform.
