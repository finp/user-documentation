= About the {customer-sso-name}

{PRODUCT_SHORT} includes an instance of {rhsso-name} to enable you protect any applications you deploy on your cluster.

Red Hat manages this instance, however all {cluster-administrator}s have admin level privileges to configure this instance.

A user named `admin` is used to manage this instance. Do not delete this user.
{cluster-administrator}
A {cluster-administrator} typically uses this instance to:

* create users in the `master` realm

* add an Identity Provider in the `master` realm as described in link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_single_sign-on/7.3/html/server_administration_guide/identity_broker[Identity Brokering] to avoid managing the same users in different realms

* create and manage new realms
