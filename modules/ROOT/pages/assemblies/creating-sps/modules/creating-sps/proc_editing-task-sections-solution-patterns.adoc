= Editing task sections of a {PRODUCT} Solution Pattern

.Prerequisites
* You have created a repository using the Solution Pattern template.
* You have added the Solution Pattern repository to your cluster as described in link:{adding-sps}[Adding Solution Patterns].

Tasks are procedures that you write as a section of the `walkthrough.adoc` file, the section being defined by a second level heading (`==`).

.Procedure
The template already contains a sample task, you can change it as follows:

. Edit the `walkthroughs/1-template-walkthrough/walkthrough.adoc` file.

. Change the task title, for example, `== Doing the first task`.

. Write a short introduction to the task.

. Change the task timing estimate. Each task has an attribute to communicate the approximate time that the task should take the user to perform.
+
This is displayed in the Solution Pattern overview as part of the task list.
+
For example to change the estimated time for the first task to 12 minutes:
+
----
[time=12]
== Doing the first task
----

. Save, commit and push your changes.
+
NOTE: The content of the {webapp} does not change automatically after a change in the subscribed repository. You must redeploy the {webapp} for the change to be visible.

+
. Redeploy the {webapp}:
.. Navigate to the *webapp* project in OpenShift.
.. Click on the *tutorial-web-app* deployment config.
.. Click the *Deploy* button.

+
NOTE: You can create another level of subtasks by creating a third level heading (`===`). Subtasks are displayed in the {webapp} on the parent task page.
