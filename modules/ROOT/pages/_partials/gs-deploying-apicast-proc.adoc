= About APIcast API gateway options

APIcast is an NGINX based API gateway used to integrate your internal and external API services with the 3scale Platform.

There are two APIcast deployment options:

*Embedded APIcast*: {PRODUCT_SHORT} hosts APIcast in the cluster. In this case, APIcast is already deployed for you, but is not suitable for a production environment.

*Self-managed APIcast*: You can deploy APIcast wherever you want. The self-managed mode is the intended mode of operation for production environments. Here are a few recommended options to deploy APIcast:

For instructions about deploying a self-managed APIcast, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_3scale_api_management/2.5/html/installing_3scale/installing-apicast[Installing APIcast], noting that you must perform the tasks as the *customer-admin* user.
