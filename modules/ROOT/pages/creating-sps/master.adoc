[id="about-creating-solution-patterns"]
= Creating Solution Patterns

Solution Patterns are templates that shorten development time and encourage best practices. You can create a Solution Pattern to communicate technical concepts and provide guidance for users.
Your Solution Pattern should have a clear user story that addresses a goal.


To write a Solution Pattern you require a knowledge of:

* AsciiDoc: A lightweight markup language that is similar to Markdown.
* JSON: A lightweight format for storing and transporting data.
* Git: An open source distributed version control system. You must push your AsciiDoc and JSON files to a Git repository.
* OpenShift: A platform for developing and running containerized applications. You can add Solution Patterns using the OpenShift console.


You must edit an AsciiDoc file to create a Solution Pattern. The AsciiDoc file should resemble the following example:

[source,asciidoc]
----
= Demonstrating features <1>

A short description for the feature. <2>

== Doing a task <3>

. Do this first: <4>
. Do this second:
----
<1> Solution Pattern title. You can only have a single level 1 heading per file.
<2> The first line of the introduction is displayed as a tag line for the Solution Pattern and displayed on the {webapp} home page.
Do not use AsciiDoc attributes in this line because they are not displayed correctly on the homepage.
<3> A task contains one or more subtasks.
<4> A numbered list of steps the user must perform.


.Additional resources

* For more information on writing in AsciiDoc, see the link:http://asciidoc.org/[Asciidoc Homepage^]

[id="adding-solution-patterns"]

= Adding Solution Patterns to your {PRODUCT_SHORT} cluster

The home page of the {webapp} lists the Solution Patterns from all the Git repositories you are subscribed to. Any user can add Solution Patterns to your cluster.

This procedure describes how to subscribe your cluster to a Git repository that contains Solution Patterns.


.Procedure
. Navigate to the *Solution Explorer*.

. Click the gear icon in the top right to display the *Application settings* screen.

. Enter the URLs of the Solution Pattern repositories you want to add to your cluster using the following syntax:
+
----
https://github.com/<org>/<repo>.git

+
[NOTE]
====
* List URLs in the order you want them to appear in the {webapp}.
* Enter one URL per line.
* To include a specific branch, append #<branch-name> to the url.
====

. Click *Save*.
+
Editing the value triggers an automatic redeployment of the {webapp}.

. When the deployment is complete, refresh your browser.
+
You should now see new Solution Patterns available from the dashboard.
